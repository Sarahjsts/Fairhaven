Hi Professor Mattos,

So I believe, in order to actually play this sort of working skeleton of a game,  you need to download the Unity editor and you can find that here: https://unity3d.com/ This software is free, just download the Personal version. Once you've downloaded that, you will need to create a unity id and once that's done, you should be good to download the project and run it in the unity editor. Once you have it up and running, go to file and open scene. To view the code, all my scripts are in the Scripts folder.
